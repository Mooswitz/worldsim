# worldsim
My adaptation of the world. It will (someday) simulate the world from the beginning using total randomness.

Conventions:

    Variables of any type are written Camelcase beginning lowercase set with the type eg.:
        - intIntegerVariable
        - floatFloatVariable
        - strStringVariable
        - tupArray
        - oObject
        - cClass
        and so on...

    Code must be formatted within the conventions of Pep8! 
    - Better use autopep8 or any code-formatting tool that meets the convention.
